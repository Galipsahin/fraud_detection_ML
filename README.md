'Fraud' in credit card transactions refers to the unauthorized and unwanted use of an account by someone other than the account holder. Necessary measures can be taken to stop such misuse and protect against similar incidents. In other words, Credit Card Fraud occurs when a person uses someone else's credit card for personal reasons, without the cardholder and issuing authorities being aware of it.

Fraud detection involves monitoring the activities of a population to predict, detect, or prevent undesirable behaviors such as fraud, abuse, and defaults. This is a very important issue that attracts the attention of communities such as machine learning and data science, as its solution can be automated. This problem is particularly challenging from a learning perspective because it involves several factors, such as class imbalance. The number of legitimate transactions significantly exceeds fraudulent ones. Additionally, transaction patterns often change their statistical properties over time.
